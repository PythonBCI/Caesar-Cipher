# Caesar-Cipher
Building a basic Caesar Cipher that shifts letters by a given number. It's a basic form of encryption. I am building this with the help of FreeCodeCamp.

## What it does
Shifts each letter in a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## What I learned
- Working with string manipulation
- Using modulo operator for wrapping around the alphabet
- Handling user input validation

## How to run
```
python caesar_cipher.py
```
